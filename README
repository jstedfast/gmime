HISTORY
-------

As a developer and user of Electronic Mail clients, I had come to
realize that the vast majority of E-Mail client (and server) software
had less-than-satisfactory MIME implementations. More often than not
these E-Mail clients created broken MIME messages and/or would
incorrectly try to parse a MIME message thus subtracting from the full
benefits that MIME was meant to provide. GMime is meant to address
this issue by following the MIME specification as closely as possible
while also providing programmers with an extremely easy to use
high-level application programming interface (API).
